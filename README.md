# poshwrite - a powershell text writer
This is just a stupid script I started writing when I was bored, but for some reason I decided to continue with it,
and now we have this. Why I decided to continue making it, I have no idea...

Note that there is a *very* specific reason as to why I called this a text *writer* instead of a text *editor*. It has
no real editing features, like you can't load already existing files into it, and even if you could that'd be pretty useless
since you can't press backspace at the end of a line to go to the previous one.

Consider it an open-source PowerShell clone of `copy con` with an actual interface and a few added features. That's about it.
